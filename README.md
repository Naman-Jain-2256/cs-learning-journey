# 💻 Computer Science Learning Journey

🎯 *A beginner-friendly roadmap to learn Computer Science from scratch — building strong foundations, one topic at a time.*

This repository documents my journey through core Computer Science topics, structured in a simple and topic-wise manner. The goal is to understand not just how to code, but how computers really work behind the scenes.
