# 💻 Hardware vs Software – What’s the Deal?

Imagine your computer is like a **superhero**:  
- 🦾 **Hardware** = the *muscles and body* – strong, solid, visible  
- 🧠 **Software** = the *brain and personality* – it decides what to do, when, and how  

Together, they’re unstoppable. Let’s break it down!

## 🧱 What is Hardware?

**Hardware** is the **physical parts** of your computer you can touch and see:

- Monitor  
- Keyboard  
- Mouse  
- CPU  
- Hard Drive  
- Motherboard  

It’s the **stage** where all digital action happens.

## 📜 What is Software?

**Software** is a set of **invisible instructions** that tell hardware what to do.  
It includes everything from:

- Operating Systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
- Web Browsers (Chrome, Firefox)  
- Games  
- Code Editors  
- Antivirus Tools  
- Calculator or Notepad apps  

Software lives inside your storage, springs into RAM, and commands the hardware.

## 🧠 How They Work Together

When you:

1. Power on your laptop (Hardware ✅)  
2. Launch Google Chrome (Software ✅)  
3. Type into ChatGPT (Hi there! 👋)  

Here's what happens:

- Software: “Hey CPU, display a browser window!”
- Hardware: “Got it – rendering with GPU and storing in RAM.”

Like peanut butter and jelly — awesome alone, but **legendary together**.
